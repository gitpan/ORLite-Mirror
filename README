NAME
    ORLite::Mirror - Extend ORLite to support remote SQLite databases

SYNOPSIS
      # Regular ORLite on a readonly SQLite database
      use ORLite 'path/mydb.sqlite';
      
  # The equivalent for a remote SQLite database
      use ORLite::Mirror 'http://myserver/path/mydb.sqlite';
      
  # You can read compressed SQLite databases as well
      use ORLite::Mirror 'http://myserver/path/mydb.sqlite.gz';
      use ORLite::Mirror 'http://myserver/path/mydb.sqlite.bz2';
      
  (Of course you can only do one of the above)

DESCRIPTION
    ORLite provides a readonly ORM API when it loads a readonly SQLite
    database from your local system.

    By combining this capability with LWP, ORLite::Mirror goes one step
    better and allows you to load a SQLite database from any arbitrary URI
    in readonly form as well.

    As demonstrated in the synopsis above, you using ORLite::Mirror in the
    same way, but provide a URL instead of a file name.

    If the URL explicitly ends with a '.gz' or '.bz2' then ORLite::Mirror
    will decompress the file before loading it.
